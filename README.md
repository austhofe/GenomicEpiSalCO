## About The Project

Through a collaboration with the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (CDPHE), the projct will merge routine public health surveillance of *Salmonella* genomic data with ecological data at the census-tract level. While our prior work showed an association between precipitation, drought, and salmonellosis in the southwest, public health partners were interested in understanding specific areas throughout the state with a greater risk of environmental-exposure transmission of *Salmonella*. 

## Getting Started

This is a GitHub repository for a research project that explores the association between precipitation, drought, and presence and density of livestock on human enteric illness in Colorado. All data, except human case data, are available via this compendium. Instructions for collecting data, as well as code for merging and linking data are available to help others reproduce the results and conduct this work in other areas. Although surveillance data in this analysis are not considered protected health information, health data require a data use agreement with each individual state health department in order to gain access. Please contact the lead author for further guidance: Erika Austhof, [barrette\@arizona.edu](mailto:barrette@arizona.edu)

To get started using any data or code, click on the folder and file you want. Click on the Copy button in order to copy and paste it into your own code line, or clone the repository to your own GitHub to get access to the full project.

### Data Sources
Data Sources used in this analysis

•	[PRISM](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/explorer/), meteorological data daily and 30-year normals by census-tract-level population-weighted centroid 


## Usage and Resources

This project is set up so that you can follow the same protocol that we did in your own work, with data sources, R and Stata code, and additional resources for merging data with data in your own jurisdiction.
